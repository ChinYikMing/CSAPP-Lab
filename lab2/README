This is an x86-64 bomb for self-study students. 

Note: only record bomb 6 design because it is the harderst one

Machine/Tools Info:
1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. Kernel: 5.15.0-46-generic
3. ISA: x86_64
4. gdb: 9.2
5. readelf: 2.34(section file is from command: readelf -S ./bomb)

Bomb 6 Design:
1. input should be 6 integers and should be < 7 -> [1, 6] is the most suitable input
2. input integers cannot be same -> [1, 2, 3, ..., 6] is the most suitable input
3. input integers will be replaced with (7 - x) where x in [1, 2, 3, ..., 6]. E.g., 1 2 3 4 5 6 => 6 5 4 3 2 1
4. x has a key value k, where x in [1, 2, 3, ..., 6] and k in [332, 168, 924, 691, 477, 443]
5. input integers order matters such that: key(x[i]) >= key(x[i + 1]) for x in [1, 2 ,3, ..., 6] after design 3 occured

So the only input integers order is: 4 3 2 1 6 5 since we will get 3 4 5 6 1 2 after design 3 occured and fulfil design 5
